    <h1>Even More Odd Photos</h1>
    <div>
      <p>The problem is asking us to find the most number of groups Farmer John can arrange his cows in. Each cow has a specific number. We will ignore the "cow" part. The simpler question is, "When given these ... numbers, how many groups can you get when you arrange the groups' numbers in this pattern: Even, Odd, Even, Odd. The group's number is found by adding the numbers inside the group." To find the maximum number of groups, we will have to find the way to put numbers in groups, with as less numbers in a group as possible. First, remember the arithimetic rules about even and odd numbers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Even + Even = Even</li>
        <li>Odd + Odd = Even</li>
        <li>Even + Odd = Odd</li>
        <li>Odd + Even = Odd</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let us think about the simple problems first. What will happen if there are only even numbers? What will happen if there are only odd numbers? What will happen if there are the same number of even and odd numbers? There can only be one group when every number is even. It is impossible to get an odd number just by adding even numbers. So, we can add this line of code:</p>
      <div id="code">
        <pre>
          if odd == 0:
            groups = 1
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>If there are only odd numbers, then 3 odd numbers will become an odd and an even. So, if the number of odd numbers is divisible by 3, then you just have to multiply it by 2/3. If the number of odd numbers can be divided by 3 and has a remainder of 2,  then you can multiply it by 2/3 and then add 1 to it. If the remainder is 1, however, you can subtract 2 from the number of odd numbers and calculate it that way. Therefore, we can add this line of code:</p>
      <div id="code">
        <pre>
          elif even == 0:
              if odd%3 == 0:
                  groups = odd*(2/3)
              elif odd%3 == 1:
                  groups = ((odd-1)*(2/3)) - 1
              else:
                  groups = ((odd-2)*(2/3)) + 1
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>If the number of even numbers and the number of odd numbers are the same, then we can add the number of evens and the number of odds together.</p>
      <div id="code">
        <pre>
          elif even == odd:
              groups = odd*2
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>If the number of evens is greater than the number of odds, then you can combine the extra evens into one even. So, you can first distribute the number of evens and odds, and then add the last even.</p>
      <div id="code">
        <pre>
          elif even > odd:
              groups = (odd*2) + 1
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>Finally, if the odds are greater than the evens, we can distribute the evens and use the extra  odd numbers as though there are no evens.</p>
      <div id="code">
        <pre>
          elif odd > even:
              x = 0
              if (odd - even)%3 == 0:
                  x = (odd-even)*(2/3)
              elif (odd - even)%3 == 1:
                  x = (((odd-even)-1)*(2/3)) + 1
              else:
                  x = (((odd-even)-2)*(2/3)) + 1
              groups = (even * 2) + x
        </pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The final code looks like this:</p>
    <div id="code">
        <pre>
          import math

          number = int(input("How many cows are there: "))

          even = 0
          odd = 0

          for i in range(number):
              x = int(input("Enter the tag: "))
              if x%2 == 0:
                  even += 1
        
          odd = number - even

          if odd == 0:
              groups = 1
          elif even == 0:
              if odd%3 == 0:
                  groups = odd*(2/3)
              elif odd%3 == 1:
                  groups = ((odd-1)*(2/3)) - 1
              else:
                  groups = ((odd-2)*(2/3)) + 1
          elif even == odd:
              groups = odd*2
          elif even > odd:
              groups = (odd*2) + 1
          elif odd > even:
              x = 0
              if (odd - even)%3 == 0:
                  x = (odd-even)*(2/3)
              elif (odd - even)%3 == 1:
                  x = (((odd-even)-1)*(2/3)) + 1
              else:
                  x = (((odd-even)-2)*(2/3)) + 1
              groups = (even * 2) + x

          groups = math.floor(groups)
          print("There are", groups, "groups of cows.")
