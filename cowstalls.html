    <h1>Just Stalling</h1>
    <div>
      <p>This problem gives us the height of some cows, then gives us the height of some stalls, and wants us to find how many possble arrangements there are. You might remember how to find the number of arrangements in math. It is called PERMUTATIONS. If you don't know about them, check out this <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/combinatorics/combinations-permutations.html">website</a>.</p>
      <p>For this problem, there are not just a set number of spaces possible. The number of spaces depends on the size of the number. First, we set to arrays, stalls_height and cows_height. Then, we set a variable that represents the number of arrangements. This variable will be "ways". Then, we sort the cows height from largest to smallest.</p>
      <div id="code">
        <pre>
          N = int(input("Number of cows: "))
          stalls_height = []
          cows_height = []
          ways = 1
          for i in range(N):
              stalls_height.append(int(input("Height of stall: ")))
          stalls_height.sort()
          for i in range(N):
              cows_height.append(int(input("Height of cow: ")))
          cows_height.sort()
          cows_height.reverse()
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>After this, we can start from the beginning of the first array, and see how many stalls the cow can fit in. Then, we multiply the ways variable by the number of stalls. The second cow, which is shorter than the first one, since we sorted the array, will fit in another number of stalls. However, one of the stalls is already occupied by the first cow. So, we multiply the ways that the second cow can go in with the previous number of ways. We do this step with all of the numbers in the cow array. The final code is:</p>
      <div id="code">
        <pre>
          N = int(input("Number of cows: "))
          stalls_height = []
          cows_height = []
          ways = 1
          for i in range(N):
              stalls_height.append(int(input("Height of stall: ")))
          stalls_height.sort()
          for i in range(N):
              cows_height.append(int(input("Height of cow: ")))
          cows_height.sort()
          cows_height.reverse()
          for i in range(N):
              stallsPossible = 0
              for j in range(N):
                  if cows_height[i] <= stalls_height[j]:
                      stallsPossible += 1
              stallsPossible -= (i)
              ways *= stallsPossible

          print (ways)
        </pre>
      </div>
