    <h1>Number of Trailing Zeros of N</h1>
    <h2>First Method:</h2>
    <p>First, I knew that when a 2 is multiplied by 5, it gets a 10, which has 1 zero. So, my first code counted the number of fives that can be divided and the number of 2's that can be divided. Then, it groups one two and one five, and got 1 zero. My first code looked like this:</p>
    <div id="code">
      <pre>
        def zeros(n):
            twos = 0
            fives = 0
            while n > 0:
                number = n
                while number%2 == 0:
                    number /= 2
                    twos += 1
                while number%5 == 0:
                    number /= 5
                    fives += 1
                      
               n -= 1
            while twos > 0 and fives > 0:
                zeros += 1
                twos -= 1
                fives -= 1
              
            return zeros
      </pre>
    </div>
    <h2>Second Method</h2>
    <p>I realized that the number of fives will always be smaller than the number of twos, so my code became this:</p>
    <div id="code">
      <pre>
        def zeros(n):
            fives = 0
            while n > 0:
                number = n
                while number%5 == 0:
                    number /= 5
                    fives += 1
        
               n -= 1
        
            return fives
      </pre>
    </div>
    <h2>Third Method</h2>
    <p>Instead of counting the number of fives that way, we know that every fifth number has 1 five, every 25th number has 2 fives, every 125th number has 3 fives, and so on. Therefore, my final code:</p>
    <div id="code">
      <pre>
        def zeros(n):
            multipleofFive = 5
            answer = 0

            while n >= multipleofFive:
                answer += n//multipleofFive
                multipleofFive *= 5

            return(answer)
      </pre>
    </div> 
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
